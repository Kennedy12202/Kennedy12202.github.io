           <section class="Cyber"> Cybersecurity <br/>
            <p>I'm aiming to pursue oppertunities, espicially in the governmental sector, that would help me hone in on which avenue of cybersecurity I want to specialize in. For now I intend to study as many skills and systems as possible.</p>

        <section class="Public"> Public Policy <br/>
            <p> As a Peace, War, and Defense major, I have fruitful discussions with my friends and peers concerning the political climate both on campus and throughout our nation.</p>

        <section class="Card">  Card Games <br/>
            <p> Spending time away from my phone became I priority for me this year, and forced me to rediscover my love for card games.</p>

         <section class="Philo">  Philosophy <br/>
            <p>The psychological and societal implications of hundreds of thousands of people sharing deeply invasive information on social media both intrigues and frightens me. To this effect, I enjoy reading philosophical paper concerning this topic.</p>
